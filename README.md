## XStream

A multi-protocol, multi-threaded image-based video streaming server.

### Features
* Stream series of images (giving the illusion of a video) using multiple protocols :
	* TCP Push
	* TCP Pull
	* UDP Push
	* UDP Pull
	* Multicast (UDP)

### Note :
* This server should work with certain clients implementing a particular protocol, but I can't share the clients as I didn't code them myself.
